#Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the closing price for Apple stock data based on the following parameters

1. Opening Price

2. High Price

3. Low Price

4. Trading Volume

The primary objective is to create a model that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted closing prices and the actual closing prices.
